if you wanna make an addition + pr,
or just wanna remix the app for yourself go for it.

- clone repo.
- open in xcode.
- click build.
- done -- you're up and running.

## Features

- Perfectly synced theme transitions: When you toggle between light and dark mode, both the window and the text area update their appearance at the exact same time for a smooth, unified experience.

make changes on a pr and i'll run on my end and then build a new version :).
